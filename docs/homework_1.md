## Tasks
- Create a script named `homework_1.py` that stores your name, age, and whether you have coded before. Print each value with a short description.
- Extend the same script to ask the user for two numbers (use `input()`), convert those inputs to `int`, and then display their sum, difference, product, quotient, and comparison results (`>`, `<`, `==`).
- Add a final section that reads a number of minutes from the user, converts it to hours using type casting, and prints the result in a formatted sentence (for example: `150 minutes equals 2.5 hours`).

## Submission
- Work in your personal GitHub repository for this course; commit your changes with a clear message such as `Add homework 1`.
- Push the commit to GitHub.
- After the push completes, verify that `homework_1.py` appears in your repository and share the link.
